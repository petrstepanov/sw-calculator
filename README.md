# SW Calculator

Program calculates S and W parameters of the 511 annihilation peak of the annihilation radiation. It is possible to estimate the binding electron energies by fitting the CDB spectrum with the contributions from e+ annihilation on electrons with different wave functions. Electrons from conduction band contribute into the spectrum as an inverted parabola. Upon the shape of the parabola we calculate Fermi energy.
